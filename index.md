I am a DevOps Engineer working for a company based out of the Bay Area, California. My primary skills are Infrastructure Automation, Cloud Provisioning, and Hybrid cloud management, Ansible, CI/CD and Linux. I have around 5 Years of Information Technology experience and I am certified professional in AWS and Kubernets.

In this blog, I want to discuss and post thoughts, problems, and solutions on the current DevOps scenarios and also want to blog my journey as an aspiring software engineer.

I have good knowledge of the operations of software applications but want to improve my skills in software development as well. So, I started acquiring skills like Angular, Java, JavaScript, Swift UI, and Python to understand the Back-end of software development. I am working on a few personal projects on UI and IOS apps to just improve or to put to practice my acquired skills.
